Fictional tutorial: Software-as-a--Service Ruby on Rails App

This project was the result of the tutorial linked above. It was my first real website, and really the first programming project of any size that I'd ever done. I can't thank Rob enough for offering such a comprehensive introduction to web development with rails, and at no charge!

Its basic goal is to create a social network to link investors and developers. It can register and collect monthly subscription payments, which enable more features for "pro" users (compared to "basic" users). It was built on rails 5 and Boostrap 3, and uses several gems and services such as Stripe, Font Awesome, Devise, Paperclip, and others. 

I'm aware there is great room for improvement here; it's nowhere near the feature-set or consistency of what would be required for an actual service. While when I finished this course my head was full of ideas to expand on it, in the end it's a tutorial which serves no real world purpose beyond my own learning. That goal has been accomplished, and I'm moving on to other projects. I'll leave it on github as a snapshot of where I started.
